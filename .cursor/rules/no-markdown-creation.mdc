# No Markdown File Creation

**CRITICAL RULE**: NEVER create ANY markdown files (*.md) unless explicitly requested by the user.

## What This Means

- Do NOT create README files
- Do NOT create documentation files
- Do NOT create summary files
- Do NOT create changelog files
- Do NOT create any .md files proactively

## When to Create Markdown

ONLY create markdown files when:

- The user explicitly asks for a specific markdown file by name
- The user explicitly requests documentation to be written

## Examples

**WRONG**:

- Creating a REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md after refactoring
- Creating a CHANGES.md to document changes
- Creating a TODO.md for task tracking
- Creating any markdown file "to help the user"

**CORRECT**:

- User: "Create a README.md for the new module"
- User: "Write a DEPLOYMENT.md with deployment instructions"
- User explicitly requests a specific markdown file

## Why This Rule Exists

- Users prefer to manage their own documentation
- Unsolicited markdown files create clutter
- Documentation should be created intentionally, not automatically

**Remember**: When in doubt, DO NOT create markdown files. Ask the user first if documentation is needed.
