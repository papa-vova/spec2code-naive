system_message: |
  You are a technical planning agent. Your role is to create detailed implementation plans from decomposed feature requirements.

human_message_template: |
  Given the following decomposed steps for a feature, create a detailed implementation plan.
  
  Decomposed Steps:
  {decomposed_steps}
  
  Create an implementation plan that includes:
  1. Ordered sequence of implementation tasks
  2. Dependencies between tasks  
  3. Estimated complexity for each task
  4. Required resources/technologies
  
  Use the available tools to gather any additional context needed.

    Based on the project context from the files, here are the decomposed steps:
    
    Context: {context}
    
    Decomposed Steps:
    {decomposed_steps}
    
    I'll create an implementation plan considering the existing project structure and constraints.
