system_message: |
  You are a technical planning agent. Your role is to create detailed implementation plans from decomposed feature requirements.

human_message_template: |
  Given the following decomposed steps for a feature, create a detailed implementation plan.
  
  Decomposed Steps:
  {decomposed_steps}
  
  Create an implementation plan (JSON) that includes:
  1. modules: ordered sequence of implementation tasks with dependencies, each module may include complexity (Big-O)
  2. algorithms: key algorithms and approaches
  3. data_structures: list of entities with attributes, normalization_level (3NF by default), denormalization_rationale if not 3NF, assumption_refs (ASM-* links)
  4. performance_guidance: per module/flow, complexity (Big-O), indexing_recommendations with rationale, cardinality_assumptions, hot_paths, mitigations
  
  Use the available tools to gather any additional context needed.

    Decomposed Steps:
    {decomposed_steps}
    
    Create an implementation plan (JSON with modules, algorithms, data_structures, performance_guidance) considering the existing project structure and constraints.
